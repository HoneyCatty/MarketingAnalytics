# Welcome to Marketing 3597: Marketing Analytics Pages
## COURSE DESCRIPTION  
   The past couple of decades have witnessed an unprecedented “explosion” of data availability, due largely to advances in computing and storage technologies. More and more success stories have been reported in books and newspapers, elaborating on how companies benefit from decisions made on the basis of data analysis. Such news has attracted more companies to look for analytic talent capable of sifting through data with statistical models and translating it into guidance for business decisions. 
   This course is designed in response to the need for analytic talent in the marketplace. The overarching purpose of this course is to convey the benefits of a systematic, analytical approach to marketing decision-making, and to build skills, knowledge and confidence in undertaking such analyses.
   This course is not a statistic or math course, focusing on pure technical details and equation derivations. It is a Marketing Analytics course, aiming to prepare future managers who (1) appreciate the importance of competitive advantages leveraged by analytics; (2) understand the existence of the tools, the advantages and limitations of each tool; and (3) can apply these tools, interpret the input and communicate the output from these tools and models, and apply them to assist business decisions. 
   
## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
  After taking this class, students will: 
  1. Understand how to apply mathematical models such as factor/cluster analysis, perceptual map, choice modeling, Bass model and Bayes theory to support marketing decisions. 
  2. Be able to evaluate the consequences of marketing decisions systematically and analytically.
  3. Apply factor/cluster analysis and perceptual mapping to such marketing decision problems as segmentation, targeting and positioning decisions.
  4. Analyze forecasting models and understand their limitations and data requirements.
  5. Understand Binary and Multinomial choice modeling, and apply them in assisting marketing decisions. 
  6. Understand Bayes theory and its application in the context of marketing data analysis and experimental design. 
### “Why Marketing Analytics? Don’t I know enough about Marketing already?”  
  This course zooms beyond MKTG 3551 course in several concrete ways, but mainly in terms of operationalizing marketing concepts like segmentation, targeting, positioning, and marketing sales forecasting. By the end of this course, you will be able to extract information in the ways marketers are increasingly required to, for example, to: segment customers and markets, identify attractive targeting prospects, determine the best brand positioning in customers’ minds, develop new products that add value to consumers and firms… and more. But, most of all, you will become adept in systematizing decision-making based on powerful, proven analytical techniques. 
  We will cover a substantial amount of modeling methodology, including such topics as factor / cluster / conjoint / discrete choice analyses, heterogeneity, discrete choice and Bayesian models, etc. We will NOT be approaching these topics theoretically, that is, via equations, proofs and other things most people hate. Instead, we’ll learn how they work, when to use them, and what they tell marketers. 
### “How does Marketing Analytics differ from the Marketing Research course?” 
  Marketing Research focuses on primarily consumer / customer data collection. Marketing Research is an appropriate class for those individuals who serve in or are exposed to the marketing research function in a firm. For example a product marketing or an advertising manager, whose core job is product marketing or advertising but needs customer research to support decisions. This research will often be outsourced or conducted by a corporate marketing group. The product or advertising manager needs to be an informed consumer of this research and the marketing research course educates for this role. 
  The Marketing Analytics course on the other hand is aimed at building causal models (not brute force data mining) to already available data and is less oriented around the gathering of data. Many marketing managers want a model-building approach to analyzing and understanding reams of data, utilizing easy to use software such as Excel. Today these individuals often work in departments that model data for loyalty marketing, retention or web marketing, etc. This is a sub industry in its own right and aspects of this are sometimes referred to as business intelligence. 
## COURSE STRUCTURE
  The basic pedagogical approach is to employ a mix of learning methods, including lectures, class discussions, software tools, cases, and assigned readings. Class sessions will be devoted to probing, extending and applying the material in the readings and the cases. One could call this “Tell-Show-Do”, a sequence providing hands-on experience in using the course materials for making marketing decisions. Lectures (always supplemented by the text) will cover the concepts and models you need in order to understand – and to apply – a scientific approach to marketing. Applications are illustrated in the cases, readings, and the examples; the software tools allow for hands-on opportunities to apply the concepts and models to resolve real-life marketing problems.
